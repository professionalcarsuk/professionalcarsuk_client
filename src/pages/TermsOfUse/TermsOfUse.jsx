          You must co-operate with us in all matters relating to the booking,

          driving licence on the date booked for the test drive.
        </p>
        <p>
          After you submit the booking, you will receive an email from us
          acknowledging that we have received it, but please note that this does
          not mean that it has been accepted. Our acceptance will take place

          This might be because the vehicle has already been sold, because of
          unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan
          for, because a credit reference we have obtained for you does not meet
          our minimum requirements, because we have identified an error in the
          price or description of the vehicle or because we are unable to meet
          an agreed deadline.

          We will use all reasonable endeavours to meet any dates specified in
          the Confirmation, but any such dates are not guaranteed and, whilst we
          will use all reasonable endeavours to notify you in advance if we are
          unable to ensure a vehicle is available for a test drive on the
          specified date and to agree a mutually convenient alternative date,
          you will have no rights or remedies against us if we fail to ensure a
          vehicle is so available.

        <p>
          If we are not satisfied you hold a full UK driving licence and are
          legally fit to drive the vehicle on the date booked for the test
          drive, we will be entitled to cancel the Order and require you to
          rearrange an alternative date for the test drive.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to make a change to a date you have booked for a test
          drive, please contact us as soon as possible to book an alternative
          date. We may not be able to guarantee that the vehicle will still be
          available.

        <h3>General provisions</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Assignment and transfer:</strong> We may assign or transfer
          our rights and obligations under the Contract to another entity but
          will always notify you in writing or by posting on this webpage if
          this happens. You may only assign or transfer your rights or your
          obligations under the Contract to another person if we agree in
          writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Waiver:</strong> If we do not insist that you perform any of
          your obligations under the Contract, or if we do not enforce our
          rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean
          that we have waived our rights against you or that you do not have to
          comply with those obligations. If we do waive any rights, we will only
          do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically
          waive any right related to any later default by you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Severance:</strong> Each paragraph of these Terms operates
          separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of
          them is unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will
          remain in full force and effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Third party rights:</strong> The Contract is between you and
          us. No other person has any rights to enforce any of its terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Complaints:</strong> If a problem arises or you are
          dissatisfied with the Services, we have a comprehensive complaints
          policy (available from Professional Cars Limited).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alternative dispute resolution:</strong> Alternative dispute
          resolution is a process where an independent body considers the facts
          of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to
          court. If you are a consumer and are not happy with how we have
          handled any complaint, you may want to contact the alternative dispute
          resolution provider we use. You can submit a complaint to Trading
